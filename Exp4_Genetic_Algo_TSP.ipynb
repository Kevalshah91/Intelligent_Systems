It works well for different city sizes and adapts to various optimization tasks. This experiment shows how GAs can be used in real-world applications like optimizing delivery routes, robot navigation, scheduling, and even improving engineering designs. The algorithm’s flexibility makes it a powerful tool for solving complex problems efficiently."
